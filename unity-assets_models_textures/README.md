# Unity - Assets: Models, Textures

## Technical Description
This project involves:

- Prototyping a 3D platformer game: You’ll develop a prototype for a 3D platformer game using Unity. The final product will function as per this sample: Platformer - Final.
- Building scripts: Without using free or paid assets, you’ll learn how to build scripts that interact with Unity’s existing character controller components.
- Asset usage: You will gain hands-on experience with Unity primitives, learn what assets are in game development, how to import them, and understand the common asset types.
- Development of 3D Models and Textures: Learn the essential elements of 3D modeling and texturing, alongside understanding how to use materials, textures, and skyboxes in Unity.
- Game Physics: Understand the differences between Rigidbody and Character Controller, along with the pros and cons of using each.
- Quaternion and Euler Angles: Get familiar with Quaternion and Euler Angles in Unity.
